# ml-gene-classification
This repository contains a supervised machine learning project for **classification of gene expression and biological data**. The notebook implements multiple models to predict target labels and compare their performance.

## Models Included
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

## Key Features
- Preprocessing of biological datasets
- Training and evaluation of supervised ML models
- Hyperparameter optimization using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
- Comparison of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices
- Visualizations for model evaluation

## Usage
1. Open the notebook `gene_classification_ml.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Ensure the dataset CSV file is in the same directory or adjust the file path in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and model results.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates practical skills in:
- Building and evaluating supervised machine learning models on biological data
- Handling structured datasets and performing preprocessing
- Implementing reproducible and well-documented computational workflows
